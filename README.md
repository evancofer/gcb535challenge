# GCB 535 Challenge
We play a game in our GCB 535 class ( http://www.med.upenn.edu/bgs/documents/GCB535.pdf ). The class aims to teach students, primarily biologists, about machine learning methods and their use. This repository hosts the challenge for individuals outside of our lab.

## Structure

We'll provide two different datasets. Within each dataset (D1 and D2), we have 5000 examples. We've randomly partitioned these into sets of 2000, 1000, 1000, and 1000.

The initial repository contains the first sets of 2000 and 1000 examples for each group.

The data have 200 features. The final column is the class label that we expect you to predict.

We'll release the third set of data at the time of our class on Wednesday, April 6. At this time, we'll also release the final prediction sets with labels stripped.

If you want to make predictions, fork this repository. Make sure your predictions are committed and pushed by April 8th at 10AM EST. Alongside your predictions, provide an estimate for the performance that you expect to see on the independent validation data.

Please ask clarifying questions, and we'll try to update this README to address the questions.
